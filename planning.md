# A Portfolio Website

##### Using CSS and SASS to build a template

#### By Griffin P. Longtin and Cheryl Frankenfield, 12/6/17

## Description

_This website is a portfolio template using CSS and SASS elements with a focus on trying out animations. We have 4 wireframe sketches, two detailed for three viewports (desktop, table and mobile). This particular plan is for our circle navigation wireframe. Our design is minimalistic with a focus on showcasing a designer's work or portfolio within this site._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Navigate to your terminal.
* Perform Git clone command on the repo [here.]()
* Perform Git atom . command to open all files in repo.
* View index.html in browser.
* No other setup or install necessary.
* Or [click here]() to view in browser now.

## Specs

_The site includes 4 sections, including: Navigation, Header, Footer and Main._
* _Example: Header contains Logo and 4 links for: Project Gallery, Experience/Resume, Bio/Mission Statement and Contact._

_The Footer section contains a sitemap, an anchor to the page and potentially repeats some of the Header links or Social Links._
* _Example: Footer's Sitemap contains more quick links to the rest of the portfolio._

_The Main section contains an animated navigation element, which when clicked, opens a modal of content for that section._
* _Example: Footer's Sitemap contains more quick links to the rest of the portfolio._

_The Navigation section contains an animated navigation element, which when clicked, opens a modal of content for that section._
* _Example: Navigation element links to 4 sections: Project Gallery, Experience/Resume, Bio/Mission Statement and Contact._

## SASS Use Cases

_1. Currently, we do not plan on using a framework so will need to use SASS and use a for each loop function to create columns and grid for us._

_2. We will use SASS nesting to help create an animated navigation element._

_3. We will use SASS mixins for media queries and possibly color mixes._

_4. We will use SASS variables for colors, fonts, etc._

_5. We are using SASS partials like variables and component pages to split up and organize code._

_6. We created modules.scss files and using the SASS @import to pull necessary code into CSS file._

_7. We will most likely use SASS operators within functions to help with animating elements for affects._

_8. We will use SASS @extend to reuse properties on several elements._

_9. We will use % placeholders from SASS to help with creating social media icons on our contact page.

_10. We will interpolation: #{} syntax for when we write a for each loop to create our columns and grid.
